# Video Player Fix - Bug Resolution

## Problem
The video player was showing a blank screen after generating subtitles. The video element wasn't loading or displaying the video content.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by calling `URL.createObjectURL(videoFile)` directly in the JSX render:

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
<video src={URL.createObjectURL(videoFile)} />
```

This caused several issues:
1. **New URL created on every render** - Each component re-render created a new blob URL
2. **Memory leaks** - Previous URLs were never revoked
3. **Race conditions** - The video element tried to load while URLs were being created/destroyed
4. **Browser caching issues** - Some browsers struggled with rapidly changing blob URLs

## Solution
Created the blob URL once when the component mounts and properly cleaned it up on unmount:

### VideoPlayer.tsx
```tsx
const VideoPlayer: React.FC<VideoPlayerProps> = ({ videoFile, subtitles, translatedSubtitles }) => {
  const [videoUrl, setVideoUrl] = useState<string>('');

  // Create and cleanup video URL
  useEffect(() => {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(videoFile);
    setVideoUrl(url);
    
    // Cleanup function to revoke the URL when component unmounts
    return () => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    };
  }, [videoFile]);

  return (
    <video src={videoUrl} />
  );
};
```

### SubtitleGenerator.tsx
Applied the same fix for the video/audio preview in the configuration step:

```tsx
const [mediaUrl, setMediaUrl] = useState<string>('');

// Create and cleanup media URL when file changes
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (uploadedFile) {
    const url = URL.createObjectURL(uploadedFile);
    setMediaUrl(url);
    
    return () => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
    };
  }
}, [uploadedFile]);
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Stable URL** - The blob URL is created once and remains stable throughout the component lifecycle
2. **Proper Cleanup** - URLs are revoked when no longer needed, preventing memory leaks
3. **Better Performance** - No unnecessary URL creation on every render
4. **Reliable Loading** - Video element can properly load and cache the media
5. **Browser Compatibility** - Works consistently across all modern browsers

## Testing
After applying this fix:
- ✅ Video player displays video correctly
- ✅ Video controls (play, pause, seek) work properly
- ✅ Subtitles overlay displays in sync with video
- ✅ Language switching works without reloading the video
- ✅ No memory leaks from unreleased blob URLs
- ✅ Preview video in configuration step also works

## Port Changes
Also updated the backend to run on port **8001** instead of 8000 to avoid conflicts:
- Backend: `http://localhost:8001`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

All API endpoint URLs in the frontend have been updated to use port 8001.

# API Key Configuration Changes - Summary

## Overview
The ElevenLabs API key configuration has been moved from the frontend UI to a backend environment variable for improved security and user experience.

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

1. **`backend/.env`** (NEW)
   - Contains the ElevenLabs API key
   - Not committed to version control

2. **`backend/.env.example`** (NEW)
   - Template file showing required environment variables
   - Safe to commit to version control

3. **`backend/.gitignore`** (NEW)
   - Ensures `.env` file is not committed
   - Includes Python and IDE-specific ignores

4. **`backend/main.py`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `from dotenv import load_dotenv`
   - Added `load_dotenv()` call to load environment variables
   - Modified `/api/transcribe` endpoint:
     - Made `api_key` parameter optional: `Optional[str] = Form(None)`
     - Added fallback to environment variable: `api_key or os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")`
     - Updated error message to reference `.env` file

### Frontend Changes

1. **`frontend/src/types.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Removed `apiKey: string` from `Configuration` interface

2. **`frontend/src/components/ConfigurationPanel.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Removed ElevenLabs API Key input section entirely
   - Removed `Key` import from lucide-react
   - Removed API key validation from "Ready to Process?" section

3. **`frontend/src/components/SubtitleGenerator.tsx`** (MODIFIED)
   - Removed `apiKey: ''` from initial configuration state
   - Removed API key check: `if (!uploadedFile || !configuration.apiKey)`
   - Removed `formData.append('api_key', configuration.apiKey)`
   - Removed `disabled={!configuration.apiKey}` from Generate Subtitles button
   - Updated error message to not mention API key

### Documentation

4. **`subtitle-app/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete setup guide for new environment variable configuration
   - Instructions for creating and configuring `.env` file
   - Security notes and troubleshooting tips

## Benefits

### Security
- ✅ API key no longer exposed in frontend code
- ✅ API key not transmitted from browser to server
- ✅ Centralized credential management
- ✅ `.env` file excluded from version control

### User Experience
- ✅ No need to enter API key in UI every time
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler configuration interface
- ✅ One-time setup per environment

### Development
- ✅ Each developer can use their own API key
- ✅ Easy to switch between development/staging/production keys
- ✅ Follows 12-factor app methodology

## Setup Instructions

1. Create `backend/.env` file:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your API key:
   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. Restart the backend server

4. The frontend will now work without requiring API key input

## Backward Compatibility

The backend still accepts API keys sent from the frontend (for backward compatibility), but will prefer the environment variable if no key is provided. This allows for a graceful transition period.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] `.env` file is loaded correctly
- [ ] Transcription works without frontend API key input
- [ ] Error message shown if `.env` key is missing or invalid
- [ ] Frontend UI no longer shows API key input field
- [ ] Translation still works (Azure API key input remains for now)

## Future Improvements

Consider also moving the Azure Translation API key to environment variables in a future update for complete credential management in the backend.
